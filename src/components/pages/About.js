                <h5>Who are we</h5>
                <br/>
                <p>We are a bunch of young minds and we are beaming with ideas for adding values to the world of education and to the life of the people like researchers, scientists, engineers just to name a few. During our heydays in colleges, we felt the urge for having a single source information on the best college fests. This has summarily propelled us for taking up this entrepreneurial journey.</p>
